# zendtodocker
Repo of the ZendTo demo automated docker container build files

As of now, the container only prepares a basic Centos 7 container to receive the ZendTo installation.  Once final, what one would have to do to build a Docker image (and eventually run a Docker container based on this image) is to clone the repo (or get the Dockerfile), set the variables to values that make sense for the target environment, then do a `docker build` on it.

Once done, commands must be executed to create local users in the ZendTo DB, following the documentation located at http://zend.to/authentication.php#Local.

If you would like to try it even if you don't have docker installed, you can go to https://labs.play-with-docker.com/ and do this command:

``docker run -itd -p 80:80 -p 443:443 --name zendto ubellavance/zendtodocker``

This command will start a container based on the image generated by the dockerfile.

You can then click on the port numbers on the top to open a tab or new window in of your broswer that will display ZendTo.  For those who are not familiar with docker, you can then execute this command to "enter" the container: ``docker exec -t -i zendto1 /bin/bash``

Caution: PWD (Play With Docker) is free but it's not a private space and it will destroy your stuff after 4 hours, so don't put anything important or sensitive there.
